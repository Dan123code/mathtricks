        <h2>Addition</h2>
            <p>Let's take a simple equation, 53 + 39. to solve it much faster, take both your number's first place
            <br>
            value, for example, 53 + 39's first place values are 50 + 30.</p>
    <h2>53 + 39 to 50 + 30</h2>
    <p>Add them, for example, 50 + 30 = 80. Now take your number's second places and add them
    <br>
    like we did for our number's first place, for example, 53 + 39's second place values are 3 + 9 and that equals 12.</p>
    <h2>53 + 39 to 3 + 9</h2>
    <p>Now take all of your answers from all of your place value for example, we got 80 and 12,
    <br>
now we add them and that's your final answer.</p><h2>80 + 12 = 92</h2><h2>53 + 39 = 92</h2>
    <p>Now let's try something a little different, try solving 125 + 45 with the knowlegde you learned in the last trick.
<br>
See how you did for the 2nd step you did 20 + 5 but in the 3rd step you
thought you had to do
    <br>
    5 + 5, well for a 3rd digit number added by a 2 digit number, on the last step your just going to
    <br>
    add the last number in the 3 digit number.</p>
    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <h2>125 + 45</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>1st step:</h2>
    <h2>100 + 40 = 140</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>2nd step:</h2>
    <h2>20 + 5 = 25</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>3rd step:</h2>
    <h2>125's last number is 5</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>Last step:</h2>
    <h2>140 + 25 + 5 = 170</h2>
    <h2>125 + 45 = 170</h2>

<h2>Subtraction</h2>
        <p>To do subtarction faster, just do the addition trick but subtract. One modification I want to make, if you forget, always subtract
        with the biggest number first. Make sure you learn the addition trick to do this one.</p><h2>Well this was very short</h2>
    
    </div>
<hr>
    <div>
<h2>Multipulcation</h2>
<p>This trick is just like addition and subtraction. Pleaase learn them before learning this trick.
<br>
One thing I want to say, this trick is not for decimals and a 2 digit number
<br>
multiplied by a 2 digit number.</p>
        <h2>Example:</h2>
        <h2>654 x 2</h2>
        <hr>
    <h2>1st step:</h2>
    <h2>600 x 2 = 1,200</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>2nd step:</h2>
    <h2>50 x 2 = 100</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>3rd step:</h2>
    <h2>4 x 2 = 8</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>Last step:</h2><h2>1,200 + 100 + 8 = 1,308</h2>
    <h2>654 x 2 = 1,308</h2>

    <div>
<h2>Division</h2>
        <p>To do division fast, just do the multipulcation trick but do division. This is not for decimals and a 2 digit number divided by a 2 digit number. Make sure you learn the multipulcation trick to do this one.</p>
